# ðŸ§¬ Genome Classifier Performance Evaluator

Genome Classifier Performance Evaluator is a tool for evaluating and comparing the performance of various genome classifiers when processing sequencing data, such as **kraken2**, **clark**, **megablast**, and **krakenuniq**. 

This tool calculates the total running time and total memory usage of each classifier through multiple repeated experiments to help users select the most suitable classifier for genome data analysis. 

In subsequent updates, the functionality for analyzing the accuracy and AUPR (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve) of each classifier will be added to provide users with a more comprehensive evaluation and comparison of classifier performance.

## âœ¨ Features

- Evaluate and compare the performance of various genome classifiers
- Calculate total running time and memory usage of each classifier
- Upcoming: Analyze the accuracy and AUPR of each classifier for a comprehensive evaluation
